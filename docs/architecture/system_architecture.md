# System Architecture

## Overview

The system is designed to be a scalable and secure platform for [briefly describe the system's purpose]. The architecture is based on a microservices approach, with each component designed to be loosely coupled and easily maintainable.

## Components

### Frontend

* Built using React and TypeScript
* Responsible for rendering the user interface and handling user input
* Communicates with the backend API via RESTful APIs

### Backend API

* Built using Node.js and Express.js
* Responsible for handling business logic and data storage
* Communicates with the frontend via RESTful APIs

### Database

* Built using PostgreSQL
* Responsible for storing and retrieving data
* Communicates with the backend API via SQL queries

### Authentication Service

* Built using OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect
* Responsible for authenticating and authorizing users
* Communicates with the backend API via RESTful APIs

### Message Queue

* Built using RabbitMQ
* Responsible for handling asynchronous tasks and message passing
* Communicates with the backend API via AMQP protocol

## Data Flow

1. The user interacts with the frontend, which sends a request to the backend API.
2. The backend API processes the request and retrieves or updates data from the database.
3. The backend API communicates with the authentication service to authenticate and authorize the user.
4. The backend API sends a message to the message queue to handle asynchronous tasks.
5. The message queue processes the message and sends a response back to the backend API.

## Security

* The system uses SSL/TLS encryption for all communication between components.
* The system uses secure passwords and authentication tokens to protect user data.
* The system uses access controls and role-based access control to restrict access to sensitive data.

## Scalability

* The system is designed to scale horizontally, with each component able to be scaled independently.
* The system uses load balancing and caching to improve performance and reduce latency.
