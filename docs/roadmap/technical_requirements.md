# Technical Requirements

The Pi Nexus Autonomous Banking Network requires a robust and scalable technical infrastructure to support its decentralized and autonomous architecture. The following technical requirements outline the necessary components and specifications for the project:

## Network Architecture

1. Decentralized Node Network: A distributed network of nodes that can process transactions and maintain a distributed ledger.
2. Node Requirements: Each node must meet the following minimum specifications:
- 4-core CPU
- 16 GB RAM
- 1 TB storage
3. Operating System: Linux-based (e.g., Ubuntu)
4. Network Communication: Nodes must communicate with each other using a secure and efficient protocol (e.g., TCP/IP, HTTP/2).

## Smart Contract Development

1. Smart Contract Language: Solidity (or equivalent) for developing and deploying smart contracts.
2. Smart Contract Framework: OpenZeppelin (or equivalent) for building and testing smart contracts.
3. Smart Contract Requirements: Smart contracts must meet the following minimum specifications:

- Secure and audited code
- Compliance with relevant financial regulations and standards
- Integration with the decentralized node network

## User Interface and Experience

1. User-Friendly Interface: A intuitive and user-friendly interface for easy onboarding and transaction management.
2. Web and Mobile Support: Support for both web and mobile devices (iOS and Android).
3. Security and Authentication: Implement robust security measures, including multi-factor authentication and encryption.

## Security and Compliance 

1. Data Encryption: Implement end-to-end encryption for all user data and transactions.
2. Access Control: Implement role-based access control and permission management.
3. Compliance and Regulatory Alignment: Ensure compliance with relevant financial regulations and standards.

## Scalability and Performance

1. Scalability: The network must be able to scale to meet growing user demand.
2. Performance: Achieve a minimum transaction processing capacity of 1,000 transactions per second.

These technical requirements provide a solid foundation for the Pi Nexus Autonomous Banking Network, ensuring a secure, scalable, and efficient infrastructure for users and stakeholders.
