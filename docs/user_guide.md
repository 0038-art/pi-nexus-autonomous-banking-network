## 1. Introduction

The Pi-Nexus Autonomous Banking Network is an open-source project that aims to create a decentralized banking network using Raspberry Pi devices. The network allows users to send and receive payments, as well as perform other banking functions, all without the need for a central authority.

## 2. System Requirements

To use the Pi-Nexus Autonomous Banking Network, you will need the following:

- A Raspberry Pi device (any model should work)
- A microSD card (at least 8GB)
- A power supply for the Raspberry Pi
- A network connection (either wired or wireless)

## 3. Installation

To install the Pi-Nexus Autonomous Banking Network, follow these steps:

1. Download the latest version of the Raspberry Pi OS from the official website (https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/) and write it to your microSD card using a tool such as balenaEtcher (https://www.balena.io/etcher/).
2. Insert the microSD card into your Raspberry Pi and power it on.
3. Connect to the Raspberry Pi via SSH or using a keyboard and monitor.
4. Run the following command to update the system:

```sql
1. sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

5. Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```sql
1. sudo apt install git build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python3-dev python3-pip
```

6. Clone the Pi-Nexus Autonomous Banking Network repository:

```bash
1. git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/pi-nexus-autonomous-banking-network.git
```

7. Change to the project directory:

```bash
1. cd pi-nexus-autonomous-banking-network
```

8. Install the project dependencies:

```
1. pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

9. Run the following command to initialize the network:

```
1. python3 init.py
```

Follow the prompts to create a new account and join the network.

## 4. Usage
