# Architecture

This document provides a high-level overview of the Pi Nexus Autonomous Banking Network architecture.

## Overview

The Pi Nexus Autonomous Banking Network is a decentralized autonomous banking system built on the Pi blockchain. It consists of several interconnected components that work together to provide a secure, scalable, and user-friendly banking experience.

## Components

### Pi Blockchain

The Pi blockchain is the foundation of the Pi Nexus Autonomous Banking Network. It provides a secure and decentralized ledger for recording transactions and maintaining the network's state.

### Pi Nexus Node

The Pi Nexus Node is a full-node implementation of the Pi blockchain that also provides additional functionality for the Pi Nexus Autonomous Banking Network. It includes a web server for serving the user interface, a REST API for interacting with the network, and a smart contract engine for executing autonomous banking transactions.

### Pi Nexus Wallet

The Pi Nexus Wallet is a lightweight client that allows users to interact with the Pi Nexus Autonomous Banking Network. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing Pi coins, sending and receiving transactions, and interacting with smart contracts.

### Pi Nexus Smart Contracts

Pi Nexus Smart Contracts are self-executing programs that run on the Pi blockchain and automate various banking functions. They include smart contracts for lending, borrowing, and insurance, among others.

## Data Flows

### Transaction Submission

When a user submits a transaction using the Pi Nexus Wallet, the transaction is signed with the user's private key and broadcast to the Pi Nexus Node. The Pi Nexus Node then validates the transaction and adds it to the mempool.

### Transaction Propagation

Once a transaction is added to the mempool, it is propagated to other Pi Nexus Nodes in the network. Each node validates the transaction and adds it to its own mempool.

### Transaction Confirmation

When a new block is mined, transactions from the mempool are included in the block and added to the blockchain. Once a transaction is included in a block, it is considered confirmed and cannot be reversed.

### Smart Contract Execution

When a smart contract is executed, the Pi Nexus Node executes the contract code and updates the state of the blockchain accordingly. The results of the smart contract execution are then propagated to other nodes in the network.

## Conclusion

The Pi Nexus Autonomous Banking Network architecture is designed to be secure, scalable, and user-friendly. By leveraging the Pi blockchain and smart contracts, it provides a decentralized and autonomous banking experience that is resistant to censorship and fraud.
