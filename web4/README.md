# Web4 Project

This project is a self-driving car system that uses machine learning and computer vision techniques to navigate through the environment. The system consists of several modules, including the car, environment, decision, execution, user interface, and login components. The project also includes a set of utils for data processing, machine learning, object detection, traffic light detection, and real-time data visualization.

## Modules

The modules package contains the following classes:

* Car: This class includes functions for starting, steering, accelerating, braking, stopping, and updating the car's state.
* Environment: This class includes functions for detecting objects and staying in the lane.
* Decision: This class includes functions for making decisions based on the car's state and the environment.
* Execution: This class includes functions for executing the decisions made.
* UserInterface: This class includes functions for displaying real-time data about the car.
* Login: This class includes functions for user authentication before starting the system.

## Utils

The utils package contains the following modules:

* data\_processing: This module includes functions for processing the data.
* machine\_learning: This module includes functions for training the machine learning model and making predictions using the model.
* object\_detection: This module includes functions for detecting objects in the data.
* traffic\_light\_detection: This module includes functions for detecting traffic lights in the data.
* real\_time\_data\_visualization: This module includes functions for visualizing the data in real-time.
