# Pi Nexus Blockchain

A simple blockchain implementation for Pi Nexus.

## Description

This project is a simple implementation of a blockchain, a distributed ledger technology, for Pi Nexus. The blockchain is a data structure that stores a sequence of blocks, each containing a set of transactions. The blockchain is designed to be secure, transparent, and tamper-proof, making it an ideal solution for decentralized applications.

The `pi_nexus_blockchain` project includes two main components:

* `block.py`: A class that represents a single block in the blockchain.
* `blockchain.py`: A class that represents the entire blockchain.

## Installation

To install the `pi_nexus_blockchain` package, you can use `pip`:

```
1. pip install pi_nexus_blockchain
```

Alternatively, you can clone the repository and install the package from source:

```bash
1. git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/pi_nexus_blockchain.git
2. cd pi_nexus_blockchain
3. pip install .
```

# Usage

To use the pi_nexus_blockchain package, you can import the Blockchain class and create a new blockchain:

```python
1. from pi_nexus_blockchain import Blockchain
2. 
3. blockchain = Blockchain()

You can then add new transactions to the blockchain:

```python
blockchain.add_transaction({"sender": "Alice", "recipient": "Bob", "amount": 100})
```

# And mine new blocks:

```python

1. blockchain.mine_block()
```

You can also validate the integrity of the blockchain:

```python

1. blockchain.validate_chain()
```

# Testing

To run the tests for the pi_nexus_blockchain package, you can use pytest:

```
1. pytest
```
