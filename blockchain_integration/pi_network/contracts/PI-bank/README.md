# PI Bank Smart Contracts

This directory contains the smart contracts for the PI Bank, a decentralized banking system built on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Overview

The PI Bank smart contracts provide a secure and transparent way to manage financial transactions, accounts, and assets. The contracts are written in Solidity and are designed to be modular, scalable, and extensible.

## Contract Structure 

The contracts are organized into the following subdirectories:

1. interfaces: Contains interface contracts that define the API for the PI Bank.
2. libraries: Contains library contracts that provide utility functions for the PI Bank.
3. contracts: Contains the main PI Bank contracts, including the PIBank contract.

## Contracts 

### PIBank 

The PIBank contract is the main contract for the PI Bank. It provides functions for:

1. Creating and managing accounts
2. Depositing and withdrawing assets
3. Transferring assets between accounts
4. Managing account balances and transaction history

### Other Contracts 

- PIBankInterface: Defines the API for the PI Bank.
- PIBankLibrary: Provides utility functions for the PI Bank.
- PIBankToken: Represents the PI Bank token.

## Installation 

To use the PI Bank smart contracts, follow these steps:

- Install Node.js and npm (the package manager for Node.js).
- Install the Solidity compiler using npm: npm install -g solc.
- Compile the contracts using the Solidity compiler: solc --bin --abi contracts/PIBank.sol.
- Deploy the contracts to the Ethereum blockchain using a deployment tool such as Truffle or Remix.

## Usage 

To use the PI Bank smart contracts, interact with the PIBank contract using the Ethereum blockchain. You can use a Web3 library such as Web3.js or Ethers.js to interact with the contract.
