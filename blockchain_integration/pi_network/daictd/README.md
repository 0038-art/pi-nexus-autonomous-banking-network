# Advanced Threat Detection and Mitigation System

This is a high-tech threat detection and mitigation system that utilizes advanced AI, blockchain, and network technologies to detect and respond to threats in real-time.

## Features

* Advanced threat detection using machine learning algorithms
* Real-time threat mitigation using AI-powered decision-making
* Blockchain-based incident response and verification
* Secure network communication using cryptographic protocols
* Integration with various data sources and systems

## Architecture

The system consists of the following components:

* Threat Detection Model: uses machine learning algorithms to detect threats
* Threat Mitigation Model: uses AI-powered decision-making to respond to threats
* AI Engine: processes input data and generates output
* Blockchain: stores incident response data and verifies signatures
* Network: enables secure communication between components
* Security Oracle: generates cryptographic keys and signs data
* Security Incident Response: reports incidents and verifies responses

## API Endpoints

* `/detect_threat`: detects threats using the threat detection model
* `/mitigate_threat`: responds to threats using the threat mitigation model
* `/process_input`: processes input data using the AI engine
* `/add_block`: adds a new block to the blockchain
* `/send_data`: sends data over the network
* `/report_incident`: reports an incident and receives a response
* `/verify_response`: verifies a response signature

## Getting Started

1. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the system using `python main.py`
3. Use the API endpoints to interact with the system
