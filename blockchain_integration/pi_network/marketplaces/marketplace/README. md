# Marketplace Module

This directory contains the codebase for the marketplace module of the Pi Nexus Autonomous Banking Network. The marketplace module is responsible for managing the buying and selling of goods and services within the network.

## Directory Structure

The directory structure is as follows:

1. contracts: This folder contains the Solidity code for smart contracts related to the marketplace module.
2. node: This folder contains the Python code for implementing a node in the marketplace module.
3. utils: This folder contains utility scripts used by the marketplace module.

## Smart Contracts

The contracts folder contains the following smart contracts:

1. Marketplace.sol: This contract manages the buying and selling of goods and services within the network. It includes functions for creating listings, placing bids, and finalizing transactions.
2. Escrow.sol: This contract is used to hold funds in escrow during a transaction. It ensures that the seller receives payment only after the buyer has received the goods or services.
3. Node Implementation

The node folder contains the following Python scripts:

1. marketplace_node.py: This script implements a node in the marketplace module. It handles incoming requests, communicates with other nodes, and interacts with the smart contracts.
2. config.py: This script contains configuration settings for the marketplace node.

## Utility Scripts

The utils folder contains the following utility scripts:

1. generate_keys.py: This script generates cryptographic keys for the marketplace module.
2. encode_data.py: This script encodes data for use in the smart contracts.
3. decode_data.py: This script decodes data received from the smart contracts.
