# Nexus Smart Chain Bridge Contracts

This repository contains the bridge contracts for the Nexus Smart Chain, a part of the PI-Nexus Autonomous Banking Network.

# Overview

The Nexus Smart Chain bridge contracts enable the seamless transfer of assets between the Ethereum blockchain and the Polkadot network. The bridge contracts are designed to provide a secure, efficient, and decentralized way to move assets between the two networks.

# Contracts

The following contracts are included in this repository:

- NexusSmartChainBridgeFactory: A factory contract that deploys new bridge contracts.
- NexusSmartChainRelayerFactory: A factory contract that deploys new relayer contracts.
- NexusSmartChainTokenFactory: A factory contract that deploys new token contracts.
- NexusSmartChainBridge: A bridge contract that enables the transfer of assets between Ethereum and Polkadot.
- NexusSmartChainRelayer: A relayer contract that relays messages between Ethereum and Polkadot.
- NexusSmartChainToken: A token contract that represents an asset on the Nexus Smart Chain.
