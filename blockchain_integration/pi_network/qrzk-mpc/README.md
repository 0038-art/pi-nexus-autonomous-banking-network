# QRZK-MPC

Quantum-Resistant, Zero-Knowledge Proof-based Secure Multi-Party Computation for Private Decentralized Data Sharing
QRZK-MPC is a project that aims to provide a quantum-resistant, zero-knowledge proof-based secure multi-party computation system for private decentralized data sharing. The project is built on top of the pi-network and is part of the pi-nexus-autonomous-banking-network project.

# Getting Started

To get started with QRZK-MPC, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/pi-nexus-autonomous-banking-network.git
cd pi-nexus-autonomous-banking-network/blockchain_integration/pi_network/qrzk-mpc`

2. Build the project:

`cargo build --release`

3. Run the project:

`./target/release/qrzk-mpc`

# Directory Structure

The QRZK-MPC project has the following directory structure:

- src/: Contains the main entry point for the QRZK-MPC system and the library implementation.
- tests/: Contains the test suites for the zk-SNARKs and zk-STARKs implementations.
- utils/: Contains the logging and error handling utilities.
- crypto/: Contains the cryptography implementations.
- lattice/: Contains the lattice-based cryptography implementation (e.g., NTRU, Ring-LWE).
- code/: Contains the code-based cryptography implementation (e.g., McEliece, Reed-Solomon).
- hash/: Contains the hash-based signatures implementation (e.g., SPHINCS, XMSS).
- zk/: Contains the zero-knowledge proof implementation (e.g., zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs).
- data/: Contains the decentralized data storage and private decentralized data sharing implementations.
- lib/: Contains the peer-to-peer networking implementation (e.g., libp2p).
- node/: Contains the node implementation (e.g., Rust-based node).
- protocols/: Contains the zk-SNARKs and zk-STARKs protocol implementations.
