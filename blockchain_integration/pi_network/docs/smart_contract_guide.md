# Pi Network Smart Contract Guide

Welcome to the Pi Network Smart Contract Guide! This guide provides detailed information on how to create, deploy, and interact with smart contracts on the Pi Network.

## Creating a Smart Contract

To create a smart contract on the Pi Network, you'll need to write a contract in a programming language such as Solidity or Vyper. You can then compile the contract using a compiler such as `solc` or `vyper`.

## Deploying a Smart Contract

To deploy a smart contract on the Pi Network, you'll need to use the `pi-cli` command-line tool. You can deploy a contract by running the following command:
