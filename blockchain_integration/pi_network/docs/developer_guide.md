# Pi Network Developer Guide

Welcome to the Pi Network Developer Guide! This guide provides detailed information on how to develop applications on the Pi Network, including setting up a development environment, creating and deploying smart contracts, and interacting with the Pi Network API.

## Setting Up a Development Environment

To develop applications on the Pi Network, you'll need to set up a development environment. This includes:

* Installing the Pi Network software on your computer
* Setting up a code editor or IDE
* Installing any necessary dependencies or libraries

### Installing the Pi Network Software

To install the Pi Network software, follow these steps:

1. Download the Pi Network software from our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pi-network/pi-node)
2. Follow the instructions in the [README.md](https://github.com/pi-network/pi-node/blob/master/README.md) file to install and configure the software

### Setting Up a Code Editor or IDE

To develop applications on the Pi Network, you'll need a code editor or IDE. Some popular options include:

* Visual Studio Code
* IntelliJ IDEA
* Sublime Text

### Installing Dependencies or Libraries

Depending on the type of application you're developing, you may need to install additional dependencies or libraries. Some popular options include:

* Web3.js for interacting with the Pi Network API
* Solidity for creating and deploying smart contracts

## Creating and Deploying Smart Contracts

To create and deploy smart contracts on the Pi Network, follow these steps:

1. Write your smart contract code in a language such as Solidity or Vyper
2. Compile your contract code using a compiler such as `solc` or `vyper`
3. Deploy your contract to the Pi Network using the `pi-cli` command-line tool

### Smart Contract Examples

* **Hello World**: A simple smart contract that returns a "Hello, World!" message.
* **Token Contract**: A smart contract that implements a token economy.
* **Auction Contract**: A smart contract that implements an auction mechanism.

## Interacting with the Pi Network API

To interact with the Pi Network API, you'll need to use a library such as Web3.js. Here are some examples of how to use the Pi Network API:

* **Getting the current block number**: `web3.eth.getBlockNumber()`
* **Sending a transaction**: `web3.eth.sendTransaction({ from: '0x...', to: '0x...', value: 1e18 })`
* **Calling a smart contract function**: `web3.eth.call({ to: '0x...', data: '0x...' })`

## Best Practices

* **Use secure coding practices**: Always use secure coding practices when developing applications on the Pi Network.
* **Test your code thoroughly**: Always test your code thoroughly before deploying it to the Pi Network.
* **Use version control**: Always use version control when developing applications on the Pi Network.

## Next Steps
