This file details the implementation of state channels within the project.

# State Channel Implementation Guide

## Introduction
This document provides a detailed guide on implementing state channels for the Pi Network Layer 2 Scaling project.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js installed
- Hardhat framework set up
- Basic understanding of Ethereum smart contracts

## Steps to Implement State Channels

1. **Set Up Hardhat Project**
  ```bash
  1. npx hardhat init
  ```

2. **Install Required Dependencies**

```bash
1. npm install ethers hardhat
```

3. **Create State Channel Smart Contract**

- Create a new file StateChannel.sol in the contracts directory.
- Implement the state channel logic, including opening, closing, and settling channels.

4. **Deploy the Contract**

- Create a deployment script in the scripts directory.
- Use Hardhat to deploy the contract to the desired network.

5. **Testing the Implementation**

Write test cases using Mocha and Chai to ensure the state channel functionality works as expected.

# Conclusion

This guide provides a foundational approach to implementing state channels in the Pi Network Layer 2 Scaling project. Additional features and optimizations can be incorporated as needed.
