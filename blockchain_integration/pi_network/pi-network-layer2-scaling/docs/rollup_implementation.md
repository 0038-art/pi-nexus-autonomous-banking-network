# Rollup Implementation Guide

## Introduction

This document provides a detailed guide on implementing rollups for the Pi Network Layer 2 Scaling project.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed
- Hardhat framework set up
- Basic understanding of Ethereum smart contracts

## Steps to Implement Optimistic Rollups

1. **Set Up Hardhat Project**

   ```bash
   1. npx hardhat init
   ```

2. **Install Required Dependencies

```bash
1. npm install ethers hardhat
```

3. **Create Rollup Smart Contract**

- Create a new file Rollup.sol in the contracts directory.
- Implement the rollup logic, including transaction batching and fraud proof mechanisms.

4. **Deploy the Contract**

- Create a deployment script in the scripts directory.
- Use Hardhat to deploy the contract to the desired network.

5. **Testing the Implementation**

Write test cases using Mocha and Chai to ensure the rollup functionality works as expected.

# Conclusion

This guide provides a foundational approach to implementing rollups in the Pi Network Layer 2 Scaling project. Further optimizations and features can be added based on project requirements.
