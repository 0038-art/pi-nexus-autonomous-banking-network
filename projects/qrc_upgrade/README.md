# Pi Network's Quantum-Resistant Cryptography (QRC) Upgrade

# Project Overview

The Pi Network's Quantum-Resistant Cryptography (QRC) Upgrade project aims to develop a quantum-resistant cryptography solution to future-proof Pi Network's encryption methods against potential quantum computer attacks. This project ensures the long-term security and integrity of Pi Network's transactions and data.

# Technical Requirements

Research and implement quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms (e.g., lattice-based cryptography, code-based cryptography)
Integrate the new cryptography solution with Pi Network's existing encryption methods
Perform thorough security audits and testing to ensure the solution's effectiveness
Directory Structure

- config/: configuration files for the QRC Upgrade project
- crypto/: cryptographic libraries and implementations
- testing/: unit tests and integration tests for the QRC Upgrade project
- main.py: main entry point for the QRC Upgrade project
- requirements.txt: dependencies required for the QRC Upgrade project
