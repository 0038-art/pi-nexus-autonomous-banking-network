# Architecture Overview

DAPIO is a decentralized, AI-powered, and interoperable Pi Network oracle that leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and blockchain interoperability to provide a secure, scalable, and reliable data feed solution for Pi Network's mainnet.

## Components

The DAPIO architecture consists of the following components:

* **AI Engine**: The AI engine is responsible for processing and analyzing data from various sources, including blockchain networks, APIs, and IoT devices.
* **Blockchain Interoperability Layer**: The blockchain interoperability layer enables seamless communication and data exchange between different blockchain networks, including Pi Network, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polkadot.
* **Data Feed**: The data feed component provides a standardized and secure data feed solution for Pi Network's mainnet, enabling decentralized applications (dApps) to access reliable and trustworthy data.
* **Smart Contracts**: Smart contracts are used to automate business logic and ensure the integrity and security of the DAPIO network.

## Security

The DAPIO network uses a combination of cryptographic techniques and security protocols to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of data. These include:

* **Public-key cryptography**: The DAPIO network uses public-key cryptography to secure data transmission and storage.
* **Hash functions**: The DAPIO network uses hash functions to ensure the integrity of data.
* **Digital signatures**: The DAPIO network uses digital signatures to authenticate data and ensure its origin.

## Scalability

The DAPIO network is designed to be highly scalable and can handle a large volume of data and transactions. The network uses a combination of techniques to achieve scalability, including:

* **Sharding**: The DAPIO network uses sharding to divide the network into smaller, parallel networks that can process data and transactions in parallel.
* **Off-chain transactions**: The DAPIO network uses off-chain transactions to reduce the load on the network and improve performance.
* **Data compression**: The DAPIO network uses data compression to reduce the size of data stored on the network.
