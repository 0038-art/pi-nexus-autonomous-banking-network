# Architecture Overview

DAPIO is a decentralized, AI-powered, and interoperable Pi Network oracle that leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and blockchain interoperability to provide a secure, scalable, and reliable data feed solution for Pi Network's mainnet.

## Components

The DAPIO architecture consists of the following components:

* **AI Engine**: The AI engine is responsible for processing and analyzing data from various sources, including blockchain networks, APIs, and IoT devices.
* **Blockchain Interoperability Layer**: The blockchain interoperability layer enables seamless communication and data exchange between different blockchain networks, including Pi Network, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polkadot.
* **Data Feed**: The data feed component provides a standardized and secure data feed solution for Pi Network's mainnet, enabling decentralized applications (dApps) to access reliable and trustworthy data.
* **Smart Contracts**: Smart contracts are used to automate business logic and ensure the integrity and security of the DAPIO network.
