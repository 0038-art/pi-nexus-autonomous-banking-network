# Disaster Recovery

This directory contains the disaster recovery scripts and configuration for the Nexus Autonomous Banking Network.

## Overview

The disaster recovery system is designed to ensure that the Nexus Autonomous Banking Network can quickly and efficiently recover from any unexpected disruptions or failures. The system includes automated backups, real-time data replication, and automated failover and failback processes.

## Features

1. Automated backups: The system performs regular backups of all critical data and stores them in a secure offsite location.
2. Real-time data replication: The system uses real-time data replication to ensure that all data is available in multiple locations, reducing the risk of data loss.
3. Automated failover and failback: The system includes automated failover and failback processes, enabling the Nexus Autonomous Banking Network to quickly and efficiently recover from any failures.

## Getting Started

To get started with the disaster recovery system, follow these steps:

1. Review the configuration files in the config directory to ensure that they are correctly configured for your environment.
2. Run the backup.sh script to perform a manual backup of all critical data.
3. Test the disaster recovery system by simulating a failure and verifying that the system can quickly and efficiently recover.

# Code

The disaster recovery system is implemented using the following code files:

1. backup.sh: This script performs automated backups of all critical data.
2. replicate.sh: This script performs real-time data replication to ensure that all data is available in multiple locations.
3. failover.sh: This script performs automated failover and failback processes.
