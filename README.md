A decentralized, AI-driven system accelerating the Open Mainet Pi Network, connecting global banks for secure, efficient, and autonomous transactions.

# Pi-Nexus Autonomous Banking Network

This repository contains the code and resources for a Pi-Nexus Autonomous Banking Network. The network is built using Raspberry Pi devices and allows for the creation of a decentralized, autonomous banking system.

# Getting Started

To get started with the Pi-Nexus Autonomous Banking Network, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
1. git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/pi-nexus-autonomous-banking-network.git
2. Install Docker and Docker Compose on your local machine.
```

2. Build the Docker image and run the containers using the docker-compose.yml file:

```bash
1. docker-compose up --build
```

3. Access the web interface for the banking network at http://localhost:8080.

# Prerequisites

To use the Pi-Nexus Autonomous Banking Network, you will need the following:

- Raspberry Pi devices (one for each node in the network)
- A local network to connect the Raspberry Pi devices
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on each Raspberry Pi device

# Building and Running the Network

To build and run the Pi-Nexus Autonomous Banking Network, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to each Raspberry Pi device:

```bash
1. git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/pi-nexus-autonomous-banking-network.git
2. Install Docker and Docker Compose on each Raspberry Pi device.
```

2. On each Raspberry Pi device, build the Docker image and run the containers using the docker-compose.yml file:

```bash
1. docker-compose up --build
```

3. Access the web interface for each node in the network at <http://<node_ip>:8080>.
